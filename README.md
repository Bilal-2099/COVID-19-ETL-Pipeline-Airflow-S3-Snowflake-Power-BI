This project implements an automated ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow on EC2 to fetch real-time COVID-19 data from the Disease.sh API. The data is transformed into a CSV format, uploaded to an S3 bucket, and loaded into Snowflake for analysis. Power BI is then used to visualize the data, enabling insights into the COVID-19 statistics.
